## The "1" Game 

Multiplayers will play the game between (2-4). The Concept is we roll a die and the number that appears on the die gets added to our score, so for example on a first roll, we got 5 on a second roll we got 4 so the total score will be 9, but the catch is when the die hits 1 your score will reset to zero(so how much you gamble is on you). Obviously, we set a maximum score for eg: 50 or 100.
